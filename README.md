## Overview

This repository contains R scripts used to analyse elevational patterns in habitat niche breadth of fruit-feeding butterflies and moths on Mount Cameroon.  
Niche breadth was quantified using the **Outlying Mean Index (OMI)** from the `ade4` package, applied to 27 forest-structure variables across six elevations (350–2200 m a.s.l.).

Two complementary metrics were analysed:
- **Absolute niche breadth (ANB)** – the total range of habitat conditions occupied across the entire gradient.  
- **Within-elevation niche breadth (WENB)** – the proportion of local heterogeneity used within each elevation.
